            <p>
                Sofie is a 15-year-old Beagle mix. Her favorite spot in the house is the living room couch. She loves to
                go outside, sometimes too much, leaving us to open the door for her constantly. Sofie loves freshly cut
                grass, she rolls around in it for hours after it gets cut.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sofie is very old, she joined our family when I was still in a car seat. Sofie loves the weekends
                because she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on the
                trail, where she can be let free to run to her hearts content.
            </p>

            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img class="thumbnail" src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>
                Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as
                long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not
                wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.
            </p>
            <p>
                At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of
                his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
                toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
            </p>

            <p>
                Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys
                running
                outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for
                occasional swims.
            </p>

            <p>
                As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and watch
                Netflix
                with his owners. His favorite treat is apples.
            </p>

            <p>
                Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German shepherd. This mindset allows
                him to
                voice his opinion, especially when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as
                he has
                learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he demands.
            </p>

            <p>
                During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on and stares outside, waiting
                either for
                guests or belly rubs. He also has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his
                father goes to
                bed.

            <p>
                Ador is 1 year old. He is a very vocal cat who loves to be petted on his head. Ador
                enjoys wrestling with his sister Maya, who is a few months older than him. During Adorâ€™s free time,
                he
                enjoys looking
                out the window to see birds and occasionally squirrels in our neighborhood who stop by to say hi to
                him!
            </p>

            <p>
                Ador is also very shy and timid. He doesn't like to be in social situations and tends to hide behind
                a
                couch or run down
                to the basement. Though, once you get to know Ador, he is very affectionate and will often lick your
                hand when you pet
                him. Ador's favorite snack flavors are chicken and turkey, and if you give him enough treats he will
                thank you for it
                vocally with his meows!

            <p>
                Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun
                on
                his side and
                lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but
                eventually,
                he gets bored and
                just stops fetching them and lays down.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn't like water (showers and even rain) or getting his
                nails clipped, and
                he's sometimes even so lazy that he'll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go
                back
                home.
            </p>
