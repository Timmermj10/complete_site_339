                    Sofie is a 15-year-old Beagle mix. Her favorite spot in the house is the living room couch. She
                    loves to
                    go outside, sometimes too much, leaving us to open the door for her constantly. Sofie loves freshly
                    cut
                    grass, she rolls around in it for hours after it gets cut.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sofie is very old, she joined our family when I was still in a car seat. Sofie loves the weekends
                    because she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on the
                    trail, where she can be let free to run to her hearts content.

                <p>
                    Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                    different
                    beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as
                    long as
                    he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not
                    wanting to
                    admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of
                    his
                    energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
                    toys "a
                    ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.

                    Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys
                    running
                    outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for
                    occasional swims.

                <p>
                    As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and watch
                    Netflix
                    with his owners. His favorite treat is apples.

                    Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German shepherd. This mindset allows
                    him to
                    voice his opinion, especially when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as
                    he has
                    learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he demands.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on and stares outside, waiting
                    either for
                    guests or belly rubs. He also has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his
                    father goes to
                    bed.

                <p>
                    Ador is 1 year old. He is a very vocal cat who loves to be petted on his head. Ador
                    enjoys wrestling with his sister Maya, who is a few months older than him. During Ador’s free time,
                    he
                    enjoys looking
                    out the window to see birds and occasionally squirrels in our neighborhood who stop by to say hi to
                    him!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ador is also very shy and timid. He doesn't like to be in social situations and tends to hide behind
                    a
                    couch or run down
                    to the basement. Though, once you get to know Ador, he is very affectionate and will often lick your
                    hand when you pet
                    him. Ador's favorite snack flavors are chicken and turkey, and if you give him enough treats he will
                    thank you for it
                    vocally with his meows!

                    Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun
                    on
                    his side and
                    lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but
                    eventually,
                    he gets bored and
                    just stops fetching them and lays down.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn't like water (showers and even rain) or getting his
                    nails clipped, and
                    he's sometimes even so lazy that he'll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go
                    back
                    home.
